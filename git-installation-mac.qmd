## Installing Git on macOS

This guide walks you through installing Git on your macOS machine for use with RStudio and GitHub. We recommend using Homebrew for the easiest installation.

### Method 1: Using Homebrew (Recommended)

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies software installation.

1. **Install Homebrew (if not already installed)**
   - Open the Terminal application: `Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal`.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen instructions, entering your macOS user password if prompted.

2. **Install Git using Homebrew**
   - In the Terminal, run:
     ```bash
     brew install git
     ```
   - Press Enter to download and install Git.

3. **Verify Installation in RStudio**
   - **Important**: Close and reopen RStudio (or its terminal pane) to update the PATH environment variable.
   - Open a new terminal in RStudio: `Tools > Terminal > New Terminal`.
   - Type `git --version` and press Enter. You should see the Git version (e.g., `git version 2.43.0`).

### Method 2: Using the Official Installer (Alternative)

1. **Download the Installer**
   - Visit the official Git website: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   - Click the "macOS" link and download the latest `.dmg` installer.

2. **Run the Installer**
   - Locate the downloaded `.dmg` file and double-click it.
   - Double-click the `.pkg` file in the opened window to start the installer.

3. **Follow the Installation Wizard Prompts**
   - Click `Continue` through the steps.
   - Enter your macOS administrator password when prompted.

4. **Verify Installation in RStudio**
   - **Important**: Close and reopen RStudio (or its terminal pane) to update the PATH environment variable.
   - Open a new terminal in RStudio: `Tools > Terminal > New Terminal`.
   - Type `git --version` and press Enter. You should see the Git version (e.g., `git version 2.43.0`).

## RStudio, Git, and GitHub Workflow

To use Git and GitHub with RStudio, follow these steps:

1. **Start/Update Project**: Create or update an RStudio project locally.
2. **Edit Code**: Write or modify R code in RStudio.
3. **Save & Stage**: Save changes and stage them with `git add`.
4. **Commit Changes**: Commit staged changes with `git commit`.
5. **Push to GitHub**: Push commits to a GitHub repository with `git push`.
6. **Sync with GitHub**: Ensure the GitHub repository reflects local changes.
7. **Pull Changes**: Pull updates from GitHub with `git pull`.
