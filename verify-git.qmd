It's easy to check if Git is already installed on your computer.

1.  **Open the Terminal in RStudio:**
    * In RStudio, go to `Tools > Terminal > New Terminal`. This will open a command-line interface directly within RStudio.
2.  **Type the command and press Enter:**

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```
3.  **Interpret the output:**
    * **If Git IS installed:**
        You will see a message like this, indicating the version number:
        
        ```
        git version 2.45.2.windows.1 # (Version number will vary)
        ```
        If you see this, great! You have Git. You can continue with the next steps.
    * **If Git is NOT installed:**
        You will see an error message, which varies slightly by operating system:
        * **On Windows:**
        
            ```
            'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
            operable program or batch file.
            ```
            or
            ```
            The term 'git' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
            
            ```
        * **On macOS / Linux:**
            ```
            bash: git: command not found
            ```
            or
            ```
            zsh: command not found: git
            ```
        If you see any of these error messages, Git is not installed or not correctly configured in your system's PATH. Please proceed to the installation steps below for your operating system.
